# FIXDemoSimple #

FIXDemoSimple demonstrates how to build messages and applications with QuickFIX/J. A sample requester and a provider can be started as Clojure applications with Leiningen.

## How to use the sample applications ##

* configure the FIX targets (TargetCompID) in ./resources/settings-prov and  ./resources/settings-req 
* The requester and the provider can send *QuoteRequest*, *Quote*, *NewOrderSingle* and *ExecutionReport*.
* The provider replies a *QuoteRequest* with *Quote*s every 10s for one minute and a *NewOrderSingle* with a *ExecutionReport*.

```

cd path_to_project
lein run requester
lein run provider initiator
lein run provider acceptor

```

To start the provider you need to specify whether it is an acceptor or an initiator, according to your architecture or the opposite party.

Type

* *q* to quit
* *request* for a QuoteRequest
* *quote* for a Quote
* *order* for a NewOrderSingle
* *report* for an ExecutionReport
